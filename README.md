You are a lead Linux developer at the top-tech company “ABC International INC.” ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck - each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers and backup those that were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.

As ABC INC’s most trusted Linux developer, you have been tasked with creating a script backup.sh which automatically backs up any of these files that have been updated within the past 24 hours.

##you use This script by changeing both of 
the targetDirectory " $targetDirectory"
The destinationDirectory "$destinationDirectory"
